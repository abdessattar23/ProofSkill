man please remember that any work we will do is production mode not developement mode so no hardcoded data no exposed API keys no low security stuff no temporare stuff, please remember this
keep updating the .ld file of tracking the changes we do
Keep the code clean, professional, and production-ready
be clear, don't halucinate, don't use any temporary code, no hardcoded values, no console logs, no commented code, no unused imports, no unused variables

If you need anything to be edited in backend ask my permisssion; if you need any api key or information ask me don't use temp ones

I will tell you the candidate workflow to work on, once the user is logged in, if it's hiis first time (you will add the property 'first_time' in backend) then he will obligatory complete his profile but uploading his cv that will instantly get's parsed and starts the interview based on his cv
